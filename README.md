# ImperativeCalisthenics
C++ training with imperative calisthenics

Inspired by a workshop I attended at [Softwareschneiderei](http://www.softwareschneiderei.de/), this is a super simple Minesweeper
implementation based on the _Imperative Calisthenics_. The goal is to just flex your brain and your programming muscles by
implementing a simple program with some very tight restrictions on the code.

## Rules/restrictions
1. Only one level of indentation
2. No else
3. Only one dot per line
4. No abbreviations, but still short names
5. Small entities (50/10/10 rule)
6. No pointers
7. No more than 2 parameters per function
8. No output parameters
9. No for- or while-loops
10. No more than 2 elements per struct
